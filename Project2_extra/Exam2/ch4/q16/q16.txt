16. Develop firmware routines for managing and operating the deadband block. 
Use the firmware routines in a C program to generate nonoverlapping signals with different frequencies, 
and dead - band values.

Answer:

Assume that we are using a PWM_DB8 digital block. A PWM_DB8 digital block comprises of two digital blocks.
One is the PWM8 block and the other is the PWMDB8 block. The output from the PWM block is used
as a reference signal to calculate the PHI1 and PHI2.

Depending on the placement of the PWMDB8 block the DxBxxCR0 (Dead Band Control) is selected and the first three bits
are modified. The 0th bit is the enable bit is enabled and disabled with the start and stop routines. The 1st bit is
the Bit Bang Mode bit, if it is 0, DB uses input reference from the previous block(PWM), if it is 1, DB uses Bit Bang Clock
register as input reference. The 2nd bit is the Bit Bang Clock bit. When Bit Bang mode is enabled, 
the output of this register bit is substituted for the PWM reference.

Assuming that the 0th block is used as the PWM8 and the 1st block is used as the PWMDB8 module, 
based on the TRM, the CR0 register is DBB01CR0 at address 0,27h and the FN register is DBB01FN at address 1,24h.

Consider the PHI1 output from the PWMDB8 block on the P0[3] pin and the output pulse frequency is 50Hz. 
Also consider PHI2 output from the PWMDB8 block on the P1[4] pin and the output pulse frequency is shifted to 50% (10 usec) relative to the first one.


Firmware routines:

#pragma ioport	DB_FN:	0x24     	// register FN for Dead Band
#pragma ioport	DB_CR0:	0x27     	// register CR0 for Dead Band

#include <m8c.h> // part specific constants and macros
#include "PSoCAPI.h" // PSoC API definitions for all User Modules

#define PWM_PERIOD 29
#define PWM_PULSEWIDTH 15		//P = 29 and W = 15 gives the duty cycle = 50%
#define PWM_DEATHTIME 2			//Dead time = 20%; (15*0.2)-1

void main(void)
{
 	M8C_EnableGInt ; 
	PWMDB8_WritePeriod(PWM_PERIOD);
