Program the CRC in C language & assembly; esimate the execution time & code size. Identify the C language constructs that lead to significant execution overhead. Propose solutions that minimize the execution time of the C program. Compare with that of the PSoC hardware block.

The PSoC program : in question folder


the C program listing file gave an estimation of 638 cycles to execute (not including 'for loop' jumps)
most of the execution time goes to for loop performing on each bit, the complexity is n

the PSoC version gives: 280 plus 16 cycles to run the CRC block as the input is a 16 bit size. This is significantly less as hardware is performing the execution faster.
