Develop (a) a cost-efficient and (b) a time-efficient algorithm 
for computing the square root of an unsigned integer number. Compare the two solutions.

Look up table - time efficient - (more hw)
the function is cost efficient - (less hw)

2^16 wouldn't fit in Flash: ~65k inputs
1) keep solutions as a byte size since sqrt(65k) is ~256
	input value is the index
2) keep a table of only perfect sqrt, need to keep an array that holds all the values
	of a perfect sqrt
	
the function: 

	//Function to compute sqroot(n)
int sqroot(int n) {
        int x = n;
		int i;
        for (i = 0; i < (n/2); i++)
             x = (x + n / x) / 2;

        return x;
}
